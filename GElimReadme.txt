-Takes in a text file and reads first line in order to make a proper size matrix.
-Copies matrix specified in input.x.txt document into matrix
-Finally copies final line into seperate array in order to represent algebreic expression that will be used to calculate output after gaussean elimination is complete.

2)Gelimmethods.java
- Contains methods that allow for the execution of gaussean elimination
on a nXm matrix.
- Contains a sum function that will use values of variables determined by gaussean elimination in order to calculate the proper output of the expression specified in the last line of the input
